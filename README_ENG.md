# Webservice PAEM
That webservice provide resources for using in PAEM UFOPA Project. This project aims to manage access of studanties and servers into the University 
by checking if the resources requested for that user is available and if the user is healthy. So, the project will have four application:
that webservice to manage data requested from other aplications; a system for manage the entrance for the concierge; a system for the user request entry into University
and finally a ChatBot for the user request entry as well.  
## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Operational System Windows 7, 8 or 10

#### MySQL database.

We are current using [MySQL Comminity version 8.0.23](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

#### Python 3.7

You will need the Python 3.7. It's recomend download the latest version 3.7.x. To verify the installed version you have to follow the steps below:

1. Opend the command line (`CTRL+R` e digite _cmd_).

2. Type `python --version`.

If the version is presented correctly, Python is installed properly. The `python --version` command can't point to a version of Python 2.x.x.

If the Python are not installed or the version is incorrect, you need to make an alternative install of Python doing the following steps:

1. Download the python vesion [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/).

2. Remember to looking for 3.7.x version, where x is the latest version:

3. download the installer of 64 bits **Windows installer(64-bit)**.

4. Run the installer.

5. Check **install launch for all user** e **Add Python 3.8 to PATH** options.

6. Click __install Now__ option. Thus, Python will be installed correctly.

#### Pip
You will need Pip installed in the Python environment. If you followed the Python installation process described in this document, the Pip installation won't be necessary, so is **highly** recommended to follow the process described here even if you already have Python installed natively on Ubuntu.

To check if Pip is correctly installed, open the terminal and type one of the following commands:

```
> pip --version
> pip3 --version
> python -m pip --version
```

**Disclaimer**: If pip was not installed you need to install.

#### Pipenv

If you installed Python 3.8 according to this document, you can install Pipenv using:

```
> python -m pip install pipenv
or
> pip install pipenv
```

To check if the installation was successful use:

```
> python -m pipenv --version
or
> pipenv --version
```
Thus you can init the virtual enviroment into the repository typing `pipenv shell`. So [leanig other commands](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv).

#### Python libraries

To install the Python requirements open the command line in repository root and type the command `pip install -r \requirementes.txt` into the root repository.

## Clone

To clone the repository follow the steps below:

1. Install the Git in your computer.
2. Click right mouse button.
3. Select `Git Bash here` option.
3. Clone repository typing `git clone https://github.com/flaviacomp/app-paem-db-restful.git`. Then now, start to code!

## Usage
#### Python Libraries
Before using the webservice you need to install the python requirements by the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you'are not developer (for deveoper use pipenv)

#### Developer
The use of this repository is the same as the other Git repositories. Only a few differences need to be pointed out. 
For an overwiew of this project see [Arquitetura do Projeto](./ARCHTECTURE.md)
##### Using pipenv
 1. First of all, you have to install pipenv as global package by command `pip install -g pipenv`.
 2. Now, for create a virtual enviroment use the command `pipenv install`.
 3. Finally, for active the virtual anviroment use the command `pipenv shell`
 
>You **NEED** to use Pipenv for package management. Because of this it was installed and should be used from now on. 
>You can learn how to use Pipenv [here](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) and [here](https://pipenvkennethreitz.org/en/latest/).

>You should **NEVER** commit using the command `git commit -m <message>`. The `-m` parameter bypass the commit template. 
>You should **ALWAYS** commit using just the command `git commit`.

##### Setup database
Run the script [create_import_db](./create_import_db.py). Ele criará um banco de dados local e realiza a inserção automática de valores _fake_ ao banco criado, usados para tests. Vale lembara que **para a criação do banco o [SGBD MYSQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) deve está instalado e as credênciais devem está de acordo com as do seu servidor mysql local, no caso dos tests locais. Coloque as credências num arquivo chamado `connection.json` na pasta database com as informações requeridas no módulo [config](./app/database/config.py), se não houver o arquivo, crie-o**.

##### Getting starter
First of all, considering usage in devoloping enviroment, you need to change the [database connections file](/app/database/connection.json) create a database run the script [create and import database](/create_import_db.py) 
by run `python create_import_db.py`. That create a database structure and import some data
test from csv files that there're into this repository. Then run the webserice by the command `python main_app.py` into this repository. 
Is the file [main app](/main.py). Thus, it's ready to make request to the server. By default the route server **http://localhost:5000/api.paem** 

##### Exemples
You can access the webservice routes by adding the server adress and the route that you need to access.

* Using browser to access to login.

GET resquest:
>_http://localhost:5000/api.paem/auth_ and parsing basic authentication

Response:
```json
{
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6MywiZXhwIjoxNjIwMzE1ODA2fQ.HYbJi6CqAxoho5bu00E464lfkXMuWixzl6CT8yz8PO4"
}
```

* Using python

GET resquest:
```python
# request all discentes recorded into database. 
import requests

# change TOKEN to valide token
headers = {"Authorization":f"Bearer TOKEN"}

res = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/api.paem/discentes", headers=headers)

print("status_code: ",res.status_code)
print("text: ", res.text)

```
Response:
```json
status_code:  200

text:  [
    {
        "id_usuario": 1,
        "login": "admin",
        "email": "admin@teste.com",
        "tipo": 0
    },
    {
        "id_usuario": 2,
        "login": "teste_tecnico",
        "email": "tecnico@teste.com",
        "tipo": 1
    },
    ...
    ,
    {
        "id_usuario": 6,
        "login": "teste_discente_3",
        "email": "discente3@teste.com",
        "tipo": 3
    },
